# RMTL
Regularized Multi-task Learning in R

# Description 
This package provides an efficient implementation of regularized multi-task learning comprising 10 algorithms applicable for regression, classification, joint feature selection, task clustering, low-rank learning, sparse learning and network incorporation. All algorithms are implemented basd on the accelerated gradient descent method and feature a complexity of O(1/k^2). Sparse model structure is induced by the solving the proximal operator. The package has been uploaded in the CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMTL/index.html

# Required Packages
Four packages have to be instaled in advanced to enable functions i.e. eigen-decomposition, 2D plotting: ‘MASS’, ‘psych’, ‘corpcor’ and ‘fields’. You can install them from the CRAN.
```R
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("psych")
install.packages("corpcor")
install.packages("fields")
```

# Installation

1) Install from CRAN in R environment (Recommend)
```R
install.packages("RMTL")
# in this way, the requirement for installation are automatically checked.
```

2) Install from github in R environment
```R
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("hank9cao/RMTL")
```

3) Install from the source code 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/transbioZI/RMTL.git
R CMD build ./RMTL/
R CMD INSTALL RMTL*.tar.gz
```
